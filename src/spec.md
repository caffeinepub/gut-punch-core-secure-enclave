# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Transform the application into ForeverRaw with a dark Gargoyle Dragon theme, implementing side menu navigation, raw messaging tone, and scan limits.

**Planned changes:**
- Apply dark mythical theme with black/charcoal backgrounds, blood-red (#FF0000) and ember-orange (#FF4500) accents, and subtle stone/dragon-scale textures
- Replace existing navigation with left side menu (hamburger/swipe) containing: Chat, Scan, Consultant, Safe Draft, Console, Profile, Upgrade to Pro
- Transform home/chat screen with Gargoyle Dragon background, "Ready to Punch?" heading, "START A GUT PUNCH" button with forged metal styling, and scan counter showing "10/10" or "Unlimited"
- Update scan screen with "Scan a Convo or Profile" heading and "Scan Limit Reached – Upgrade to Pro for Unlimited" message after 10 scans
- Create therapist/Pro mode with calmer dragon aesthetic and tools for session notes, resolution guidance, and session management
- Replace all UI text with raw, direct language using phrases like "Punch through the bullshit", "The Dragon guards your truth", "No filters. No games"
- Rebrand from GUT-PUNCH to "ForeverRaw – Home of the Gargoyle Dragon" with Gargoyle Dragon as central visual element

**User-visible outcome:** Users experience a dark, mythical ForeverRaw application with Gargoyle Dragon branding, side menu navigation, raw aggressive messaging, visible scan limits (10/day free, unlimited Pro), and therapist tools for Pro users.
