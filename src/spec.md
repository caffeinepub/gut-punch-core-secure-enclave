# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add custom domain support instructions and social media preview functionality to improve shareability and branding.

**Planned changes:**
- Add Custom Domain section in Admin Dashboard with DNS configuration instructions and status display
- Add Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags for rich social media previews
- Display shareable app URL with copy-to-clipboard button in the application interface

**User-visible outcome:** Administrators can view instructions for setting up a custom domain, and users can easily share the app with rich social media preview cards showing the Gut Punch branding and tagline.
