# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Add app market publishing configuration and OISY wallet integration to the Admin Dashboard.

**Planned changes:**
- Add "App Market Publishing" section in Admin Dashboard with price, marketplace description, and category configuration
- Create "Wallet Configuration" panel for OISY wallet principal ID and payout currency selection (USDC, Bitcoin, ICP)
- Display publishing status dashboard showing publish state, price, wallet connection status, and total royalties earned
- Add backend endpoints to store and retrieve market configuration and wallet settings

**User-visible outcome:** Admin users can configure their app for marketplace listing by setting price, description, and category, connect their OISY wallet with preferred payout currency, and view their publishing status and royalties in the dashboard.
