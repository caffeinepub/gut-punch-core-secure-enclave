  "summary": "The diff implements most of the ForeverRaw brand transformation with the Gargoyle Dragon theme and side menu navigation. Core requirements including dark mythical theming, side menu structure, scan screen updates, raw language, and branding changes are present. However, the main home/chat screen (SocialFeed.tsx) does not fully match REQ-3 specifications, and therapist/Pro mode (ConsultantScreen.tsx) lacks complete session management tools required by REQ-5.",
