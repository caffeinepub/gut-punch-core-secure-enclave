  "summary": "The diff successfully implements all four requirements for App Market Publishing and OISY Wallet Integration. REQ-1 (market listing configuration), REQ-2 (wallet configuration panel), REQ-3 (publishing status display), and REQ-4 (backend endpoints) are fully implemented with complete acceptance criteria coverage. The implementation follows the existing AdminDashboard pattern with a new tabbed interface, includes proper validation for wallet principals, and enforces admin-only access control. No missing requirements or hallucinated features detected.",
