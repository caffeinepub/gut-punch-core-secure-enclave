  "summary": "The diff implements all three requirements (REQ-1, REQ-2, REQ-3) with comprehensive coverage. REQ-1 is fulfilled through CustomDomainPanel.tsx with DNS instructions, canister URL display, and status verification. REQ-2 is addressed via Open Graph and Twitter Card meta tags in frontend/index.html. REQ-3 is implemented through ShareableUrlBanner.tsx integrated into Footer.tsx with copy-to-clipboard functionality. All acceptance criteria appear to be met based on the available evidence.",

      "reason": "The BuildRequest only mentions adding a Custom Domain section to the Admin Dashboard. The diff shows CustomDomainPanel is added as a separate tab in SettingsPanel, but the requirement specified it should be in the Admin Dashboard specifically. The implementation appears to place it in a dedicated tab rather than within the AdminDashboard component.",
